# Background Noise Elimination from Audio System

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a system to eliminate background noise from audio signals. The project was conducted as part of the B. Tech during the academic year 2020-2021. The project was guided by Prof. V.U Patel.

## Problem Description

Background noise in audio signals, whether from traffic, construction, or other sources, can significantly degrade the quality of speech communication. This project aims to address this issue by implementing noise reduction techniques in real-time.

## Methodology

The project explores various digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms and adaptive filtering techniques to design a system that can effectively suppress background noise while preserving the speech signal. The implementation involves the use of Python, MATLAB and Simulink for signal processing and system modeling.

## Outcome

The project successfully implemented several filters, including Audio Weighting Filter, Low Pass Filter, Band Pass Filter, High Pass Filter, and Band Stop Filter. The system's performance was analyzed using a range of noise sources and signal scenarios. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different filtering techniques in reducing background noise.

## Conclusion

The project concludes that while basic DSP algorithms show promise in certain scenarios, adaptive filters, such as the Kalman Filter, exhibit better performance in handling background noise. The study suggests that for Gaussian noise, the Kalman Filter performs exceptionally well, but practical noise scenarios may require further exploration.

## Future Scope

The report outlines the potential for future developments in noise reduction, highlighting the need to explore deep learning approaches for handling a broader range of noise types and variability. The incorporation of advanced technologies, such as real-time deep learning noise suppression, could enhance the system's capabilities.
